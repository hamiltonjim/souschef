Note: This recipe is from The Peach Tree Tea Room. If you travel to Austin, or San Antonio, plan a day trip
to Fredericksburg an hour and half drive from either city settled by German immigrants. There are numerous
interesting shops. Make a lunch reservation for The Peach Tree Tea Room and make time to visit Nimitz
Museum, an interesting review of World War II Naval action.
